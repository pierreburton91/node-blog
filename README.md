# NodeJS CMS
Custom CMS based on a NodeJS backend.


### Install and run dev environment
```
git clone https://github.com/pierreburton91/node-blog.git

cd node-blog

npm install

npm run-script build
```

### Why ?
I never felt satisfied with the "Go to Wordpress" way of starting a blog.
Free plans are not enough in terms of customization and freedom.

I also wanted to challenge myself a little bit with a project I could use for myself in the end.
